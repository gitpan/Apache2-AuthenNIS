DESCRIPTION

    This perl module is designed to work with mod_perl2 and the Net::NIS
    module by Rik Haris (rik.harris@fulcrum.com.au).  Version 0.13 of
    Apache::AuthenNIS was renamed and modified to use mod_perl2.  That
    module was a direct adaptation of Michael Parker's
    (parker@austx.tandem.com) Apache::AuthenSmb module.

    The module uses Net::NIS::yp_match to retrieve the "passwd" entry from
    the passwd.byname map, using the supplied username as the search key. 
    It then uses crypt() to verify that the supplied password matches the
    retrieved hashed password.

  Parameters

    PerlSetVar AllowAlternateAuth
        This attribute allows you to set an alternative method of
        authentication (Basically, this allows you to mix authentication
        methods, if you don't have  all users in the NIS database). It does
        this by returning a DECLINE and checking  for the next handler,
        which could be another authentication, such as Apache-AuthenNTLM or
        basic authentication.

  Functions

    handler
        This is the mod_perl2 handler function.
